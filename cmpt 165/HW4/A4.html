<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p class = "abstract">
“Mother Courage and Her Children” is commonly regarded as one the most successful plays by Bertolt Brecht. In this play, Brecht uses his epic theatre theories to distinctively oppose the illusionistic and Katharisis (purging, cleansing) principles in the traditional (Aristotelian) tragedies, but Brecht does not oppose dramas as tragic. This article discussed the tragic effects of “Mother Courage and Her Children” from three aspects of the play: theme, story and characters. This article discusses how ‘alienation’ technique prevents the illusion of reality about the theatre, therefore makes audiences more aware about their own reality and to think further of the tragedy in life.

<h3><A NAME="D1">  Brecht’s Critique about Theory of Tragedy</A></h3>
<p>
Brecht’s epic theatres are also usually called “Non- Aristotelian Drama”. This name states precisely that Brecht’s claim is against Aristotle’s theory of tragedy. Aristotle emphasizes the “terror” and “pity” in his theory of tragedy, and the empathy within audiences towards the plot or the characters. However, Brecht strongly criticizes on the feeling of empathy in audiences. Brecht believes that the world has changed in significant ways, audiences in the age of sciences and knowledge deserves more than simply experiencing the world, they need to acknowledge the world (Brecht on Theatre 183). The theory of empathy prevented audiences to view reality in their free and critical eyes, and make them perceiving the staged events as inevitable fate to obey. Aristotle’s ideology restricted the potential of theatres to influence the society and its ability to change the world. Brecht is trying to create the “distance” between audiences and theatres to make them use their critical thinking to scrutinize the tragedy in it, therefore relate the tragedy with reality and develop critical reviews of problems, finally further discover the tragedies in real world. Seen in this light, Brecht does not oppose that dramas are tragic.
</p>
<p>
The core feature of Brecht’s epic theory is <strong>Verfremdungseffekt</strong>, or in English, “alienation effect” (Brecht on Theatre 192). In Brecht’s explanation of this term, alienated presentation “allows us to recognize its subject, but at the same time makes it seem unfamiliar” (Brecht on Theatre 192). In particular, Brecht is trying to perform the daily content that audiences are familiar with in totally unusual ways, to make the drama has amazing effects. This makes it hard for audiences to relate the performance with common daily lives, also triggers the curiosity and astonishment within audiences. Thereby it encourages their independence and autonomy while comprehending the meanings of situations; to finally let audiences to relate the theatre with social issues and criticize on human behaviors. Alienation effect emphasizes the beauty of distance, it stretches out more space than between theatres and audiences to create an aesthetic delight in discovering and thinking. 
</p>
<p>
There are various ways to achieve alienation effect, including stage setting, acting techniques and the use of story. “Mother Courage and Her Children” is a masterpiece of Brecht’s epic theatres wrote in 1939. The play talked about the fall of Courage’s family during the 30 years-war. Mother Courage is a peddler who follows the army, and feeds her family with the profits from trading goods with army or soldiers. Her oldest son Eilif died because of demonstrating unnecessary courage in peace time; her youngest son Swiss Chess died because of his honesty; and Kattrin her mute daughter is also sacrificed to the war because of her benevolence. Although all her children are died to the war, Mother Courage is still following the war and doing her business without noticing that the war is the real murderer to her children.
</p>


<h3><A NAME="D2">History of The Second World War — Tragedy in the Theme</A></h3>
<p>
The subtitle of “Mother Courage and her Children” is “A Chronicle of the Thirty Years’ War”. Brecht uses the <strong>30-years war</strong> as the background. Within the play, before each act starts, there is a descriptive introduction about the situation of the war, and each event has some relations to the war as the story proceeds. There is a distinct difference between this play and the traditional plays, Brecht sees the history in the perspective of civilian, as in the play, war is interpreted in the minds of some “nobodies”. This is a revolutionary change of perspectives from the “ruling” class to the “ruled” class in the history of theatre, to make nobodies’ lives interact with historical moments in the 30-years war. In Brecht’s words, the story of nobody “has to be defined in historically relative terms” (Brecht on Theatre 190); and it appeals to the audiences as a different look into the history. The distance between history and the audiences’ lives makes them actively inspect the deep natures of events. </p>
</p>
<p>
In the play, all characters including Mother Courage, the Chaplain, Cook and the camp prostitute Yvette view the war as a tool to make them living, and faithfully praise the necessity of war. Brecht has made his characters think the 30-years war a treasure chest that has a “great deal in store” (Mother Courage 179) for the nobodies. However, history proved certainly that war does not have anything in store other than devastation for people, especially the nobodies. Countless people have died in the 30-years war. Therefore in the play, the Army Recruiter in Act One is having a hard time recruiting soldiers. Additionally, in Act Two, while Mother Courage is trying to sell a “scraggly hen” to the Cook, she indirectly described the cruel situation of the war – that rats have “all been eaten…in the middle of a siege” (Mother Courage 29); and as the story progress to Act Nine, Brecht tells the audiences in the introduction that: </p>
</p>
<pre>
“The greet war of religion has been going on for sixteen years. 
Over half the inhabitants of Germany have perished. 
Widespread plague kills those the war spares. 
In once fertile countries, famine. 
Wolves prowl through the burnt-out cities” (Mother Courage 165).</pre>
<p>
As expected, “nobodies” like Courage and the Cook did not get any benefit from the war, no matter victory or defeat, the cost for them is too high. They have lost everything, including their families’ lives, it is not yet the worst. The war has made them butchers of each other, morality and sympathy are permanently wiped out from their consciousness – they became merciless murderers in the war. However, they are not naturally villains, the Chaplain knows the “ones who start the wars” are to blame, and other people are all victims because they “don’t rape back home” (Mother Courage 131). Through defining nobodies’ lives in historical terms, Brecht is trying to deliver the message to audiences that the war may destroy the morality and humanity of individuals or societies. Furthermore Brecht is also trying to make the audiences refresh their understanding of the tragedy in the real world.</p>
</p>
<p>
Brecht wrote this book in 1939, it is also the year Hitler’s army is marching to Poland and preliminarily revealing his ambition to the world. However within Germany, people were obsessed by the slogans that advocate racial inequality; so they proudly volunteered themselves into the war. Brecht with his play tries to explain Hitler’s war – which is still vague but sprouting – in terms of what the Germanys are familiar with, the 30-years war. Hence they can review the true purpose of Nazi critically and rationally. Again, as it is proved by the history, World War II is a real tragedy to the entire human race.
</p>
<h3><A NAME="D3">Open Ended – Tragedy in the Story</A></h3>
<p>
“Mother Courage and her Children” a representative play of Brecht’s epic theatre which has twelve acts; and each act has minor cause and effect relationships with other acts, the events are relatively independent of each other. Still, these independent acts to some extent have a concentrated plot, which is the fall of Mother Courage and her children in the 30-years war. In the play, Mother Courage is living by following the army and trading war supplies; on the other hand, she still tries to keep her children away from the harm of the war. One by one, Mother Courage loses her children to the war; and when her last child Kattrin is also murdered by the war, she is still unaware of this whole tragedy that fell upon her live, the play ends as she keeps singing her war song and doing her war business. Sparingly to the audiences, this is another difference in epic theatre to the traditional tragedy, such that the conflict in this play is still not solved. According to Aristotle’s theories of drama, problems are still not “cleansed”, therefore the play is not over. Brecht uses open ended story as another method of alienation.
</p>
<p>
Like all other tragedies, Mother Courage did experience downfalls of her life; the war has killed all three of her children and made her bankrupt. But unlike other tragedies, the author has not made Mother Courage tragically fight against her fate, neither has the author made her tragically compromise to fate; the author simply left Mother Courage to stay in this tragedy and stay ignorant and apathetic of the true reason to her family’s downfall. When Kattrin risks her life and demonstrating another way of living – rebel –  yet unrecognized by Mother Courage, this brings the climax of the tragedy to audiences. The astonishment in the audiences kept them away from the empathy to Mother Courage, and urges the audiences to ask a question to themselves: Why is Mother Courage ignorant? This question cannot be answered until we take a detailed analysis of this character.
</p>
<h3><A NAME="D4">Mother Courage – Tragedy in the Character</A></h3>
<p>
Brecht in his shaping of the characters accentuates on the developing and changing nature of individuals. He denies the idea of completely philosophical and unconditional characters; the social circumstances and different times in the history is playing a conclusive role in the fate of characters. Brecht believes characters living in a different time "would infallibly give a different response" (Brecht on Theatre 191) on the same problems "though one is determined by the same factors" (Brecht on Theatre 191). This view is different to the beliefs in the traditional theatres that fates are determined by characteristics or Gods. This is also one other surprise given to the audiences to achieve the alienation effect.
</p>
<p>
Mother Courage is constantly switching roles from a mother and a business woman in the play. As a mother, she is selfless and willing to sacrifice for her children. That’s why Brecht has compared the image of Mother Courage with Niobe, daughter of Tantalus in Greek mythology. The seven daughters and seven sons of Niobe are killed by Artemis and Apollo because of Niobe’s pride, then she finally has turned into a stone because of devastation. Mother Courage, “like Niobe she is unable to protect her children against fate – in this case, war” (Brecht Collected Plays 323). Although she tried everything in her power to protect her children, such as she does not allow Eilif to join the army because she knows the brutality of the war; she also teaches Swiss Cheese to be honest, and thought honesty would keep him away from the war; in Act 9 she rejected the Cook’s offer during her most bankrupt days only to stay with Kattrin. Mother Courage’s character is admirable in unique ways such as the extreme desire of living, and the exuberant vitality that she demonstrates to the audiences.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, as a business woman, Mother Courage became typically selfish and greedy as any other people in business. To survive and profit in the circumstances of a war, she also became merciless, and she indirectly caused the deaths of all of her children. Eilif went “with the recruiter” (Mother Courage 27) to join the army while her attention was drawn away by her business with the Sergeant; in Act 3, she hesitates to pay the ransoms of Swiss Cheese until the execution even though she had enough money; this time money is still the motivation, in Act 9, she left Kattrin alone in the middle of a siege and finnally caused her death. Kattrin’s action to rebel the war did not wake up Mother Courage’s dream in believing war was the only way to feed the family.  It is even more tragic that Mother Courage mistakenly used egoism education as a way to distribute maternal love, this moral twist or destruction in the character is shaped by – as Brecht believes – the war situation.
</p>
<p>
Under the normal situations, Courage’s mother and business woman characters are extremely contradictory and impossible to coexist. However, war reconciled this broken relationship in the play, but at the same time, it directly caused the tragedy of Mother Courage. Individuals are usually too weak and powerless when facing a tough social circumstance. As in Brecht’s own notes to Mother Courage and her children: 
<pre>
"So long as the masses remain the passive object of politics
they will never be able to view what happens to them as an experiment, 
merely as a fate;
they no more from the catastrophe than a guinea pig learns about biology.” 
(Collected Plays, 74)</pre>
</p>
<p>
Audiences will learn when they study Mother Courage’s character, the so-called fate was merely a trick played by humans; those human characteristics seemed everlastingly contradictory could actually coexist. War is also totally preventable. However, it would cost billions of lives, thousands of annihilations of civilization, and countless squander of cultural or material wealth to make awaken humanity’s awareness of the consequence of the war. This is the true tragedy Brecht wanted to show to his audience.
</p>
<h2> <A NAME="conclusion">  Conclusion</A></h2>
<p class = "paragraphs">
Mother Courage and her Children as Brecht’s widely regarded best work uses narrative methods of epic theatre, and it is different to traditional tragedies. Through the analysis of theme, story and character of the play, it is obvious that war caused a tragedy in Mother Courage’s family. It destroyed not only the bodies of children, it also destroyed the moral spirit of mothers, and caused countless tragedies like “Mother Courage and her Children” in the families that were involved to the war. Although at the end of the play Mother Courage stays ignorant, audiences are still able to learn from her tragedy; and this is what Brecht considered the most important goal of a play – to use plays as the “apparatus of education” (Brecht on Theatre 186). Brecht urges his audiences to “suspicious inquiry” (Brecht on Theatre 192) everything has happened on the stage, and discover its deeper social causes; thereby recognize the tragedy in real life and stop it from happening. Although Brecht’s attempt to stop the war by warning his people about the disastrous consequences of World War II has failed, but his interpretations of the nature of war still remains valuable to modern civilization.
