Problem: Imagine you are in a lonely spacecraft floating in the space with nothing around. 	
	Now you want to get back to earth where everything is so awsome, but you have nothing
	to push against! How do you go home?

Solution: By Newton's Third Law, if you throw some of you belongings away to the opposite 
	direction of earth, you will gain some speed then eventually you will reach earth. 
	Fuel in rockets are burned to produce high temperature and high momentum gases, then 
	tons of gases are thrown away from the bottom of the rocktet to make it move.
